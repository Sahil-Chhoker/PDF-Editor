WATER:
Overexploitation of water resources, both surface and groundwater, is a pressing issue that has far-reaching consequences. Groundwater, which constitutes 98% of the planet's fresh water, is an essential resource for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, supplying half the world's needs overall[1]. However, it is not an infinite resource, and over-pumping can lead to a range of problems, including drawdown, subsidence, seawater intrusion, and contamination[1].

Drawdown refers to the lowering of the water table due to excessive extraction, which can impact delicate ecosystems and biodiversity. For instance, in the Great Artesian Basin, Australia's biggest groundwater basin, 98 endemic species of flora and fauna are at risk from drawdown. Subsidence occurs when the ground level sinks from over-pumping and resulting depressurization, causing the land to compact under the weight of the rock and soil. Seawater intrusion is another issue, particularly in coastal areas, where extracting groundwater from nearby aquifers can cause seawater to seep inland, contaminating bores with salty water and rendering them unusable for centuries.

Contamination of groundwater is another significant concern, with sources including gasoline, oil, chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, and mining sites. This not only affects the quality of groundwater but also the quality of surface water, as groundwater often interacts with rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands.

The overexploitation of aquifers is a global issue, with 106 of Mexico's 653 aquifers being overexploited, leading to increased salinity and threatening the viability of groundwater resources[2]. This overexploitation also jeopardizes the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly for those living in poverty and marginalization, especially in the context of a changing climate[3].

Addressing the overexploitation of groundwater requires better understanding and measurement of this resource, as well as improved regulation and management. This includes considering the legacy of aquifer overexploitation, informing the population of the conditions in which the aquifer is found, and implementing remedial actions for recovery and recharge[2]. Additionally, addressing the capitalist-neoliberal model of food production, which often prioritizes intensive agriculture and livestock farming, is crucial for ensuring food security and environmental balance[2].

In conclusion, the overexploitation of water resources, particularly groundwater, has significant consequences for ecosystems, human rights, and food security. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach, including improved understanding, regulation, and management of groundwater resources, as well as addressing the underlying economic and social factors contributing to overexploitation.
