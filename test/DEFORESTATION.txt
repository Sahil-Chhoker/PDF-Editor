DEFORESTATION:
Deforestation is a pressing issue that affects the environment, forests, biodiversity, and tribal populations. It is primarily driven by human activities, with agriculture accounting for around 80% of global deforestation[4]. Specifically, subsistence agriculture and commercial or industrial agriculture, including livestock farming, are significant contributors to this problem[4].

Mining and dam building are also significant causes of deforestation. Mining activities, such as iron ore and bauxite extraction, often lead to large-scale deforestation and water scarcity[2]. For instance, in Jharkhand, India, mining agreements have resulted in the deforestation of at least 57,000 hectares of forest and the displacement of 9,615 families[2]. Dams, on the other hand, open up areas for development and increase the likelihood of deforestation due to the construction of roads, railways, bridges, and airports[2].

Deforestation has severe impacts on the environment and local communities. It contributes to global warming by disrupting the global carbon cycle and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations[2]. Additionally, deforestation disrupts the global water cycle, leading to water resource loss, flooding, and soil erosion[2]. Deforestation also threatens biodiversity by destroying habitats for endangered species and affecting the livelihoods of indigenous and tribal communities[1][2].

To address these impacts, a range of conservation strategies can be implemented. These include community engagement in planning and decision-making processes, conducting rigorous environmental impact assessments, implementing restoration and compensation measures, and establishing and enforcing laws and regulations to govern mining and dam construction[1].

In summary, deforestation is primarily driven by human activities, with agriculture being the leading cause. Mining and dam building also contribute significantly to deforestation, with severe consequences for the environment, forests, biodiversity, and tribal populations. Implementing conservation strategies is crucial to mitigating these impacts and protecting the planet's vital resources.
