LAND RESOURCES:
Land resources encompass vital natural elements like soil, minerals, forests, water, and wildlife crucial for human survival and various activities such as agriculture, housing, and industry[2]. However, human activities have led to the overexploitation and degradation of these resources, resulting in environmental issues like soil erosion, desertification, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and land pollution[2]. Soil erosion, a significant problem caused by activities like deforestation and intensive farming, leads to the loss of topsoil, reducing fertility and productivity, while desertification occurs when fertile land turns into desert due to human actions like overgrazing and deforestation[2]. Deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and land pollution further compound these environmental challenges[2]. To address these issues, adopting sustainable land management practices like land-use planning, conservation, and sustainable agriculture is essential[2]. Additionally, preventing overgrazing, proper waste management, and sustainable water practices are crucial steps towards mitigating land degradation, soil erosion, and desertification[2].
